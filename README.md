## TODO
* Remove LESS and SASS in favor of a full workshop. Students seem to get confused depending on where this falls in class and some topics seem like they are beyond the scope of the class.
* Make sure all HTML is to spec.
* Responsiveness should be moved earlier in class.
* Spend less time on various CSS3 properties and focus on border-box and flex-box
* Vendor prefixes should be mentioned, but they can probably go away


## Course description

Through the course of this four-part class, you'll get a thorough introduction to HTML5 and CSS3 to build on your previous knowledge. You'll get hands-on experience working with HTML5 features like semantic elements and forms, and you'll learn new CSS3 properties and abilities including transformations and transitions. Finally, we'll dig into responsive design and browser compatibility.

You'll leave with readily-applicable skills and we'll be there to answer any questions you may have along the way!

To get the most out of this class, you should have a working knowledge of basic HTML and CSS. You may have taken Intro to HTML through Girl Develop It, or maybe you have built a site for fun.
